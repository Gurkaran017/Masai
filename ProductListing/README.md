# Product Listing with Error Handling

## Features:
✅ Fetches products from FakeStoreAPI.  
✅ Displays products in a **grid format** with images, titles, and prices.  
✅ Provides a **"View Details" button** for each product (alerts details).  
✅ Implements **error handling** to show a message if fetching fails.  

## How It Works:
1. The page loads and calls the `fetchProducts()` function.
2. The function fetches data from the **FakeStoreAPI**.
3. If successful, the products are displayed in a **responsive grid**.
4. If the request fails, an **error message** is shown.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML** for structure.
- **CSS** for styling.
- **JavaScript (Fetch API, Async/Await, Error Handling)** for functionality.
